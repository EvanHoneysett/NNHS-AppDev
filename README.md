===========
Welcome to the North App Development Club public repo for the tutoring center project.

It is recommended that everyone downloads Sublime Text Editor to code.

Also, give me (Jeff Chao) a message on Canvas so I can add you to the repo.

To see the code implemented, connect to http://50.4.37.55/nnhs-appdev/app/ (I will try to keep it updated)
